# Heart Disease Prediction App

This project is a **Heart Disease Prediction** application that uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on a set of health parameters.

## Overview

The app takes input data related to a person's health (such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.) and predicts whether they are at **high risk** of heart disease. The model was trained using a dataset containing multiple attributes, and the prediction is generated based on the data provided by the user.

## Features

- Predict the likelihood of heart disease based on user input.
- Inputs include health parameters like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and others.
- Displays a simple and aesthetic interface built using **Streamlit**.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **Scikit-learn**: For the machine learning model and data preprocessing.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading the trained model.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: For data manipulation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Install the required libraries using:
  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/heart-disease-prediction.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd heart-disease-prediction
Install the Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will launch the app in your browser.

How It Works
Input Data: The user is prompted to enter health parameters like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.
Prediction: Based on the inputs, the model predicts whether the person is at high risk or low risk for heart disease.
Output: The result is displayed with an explanation of the prediction.
Example Inputs
Here are some sample inputs you can use to test the application:

Age: 55
Sex: Male
Chest Pain Type: Typical Angina
Resting Blood Pressure: 140
Serum Cholesterol: 250
Fasting Blood Sugar: Yes
Resting Electrocardiographic Results: Normal
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved: 150
Exercise Induced Angina: Yes
Oldpeak (ST Depression): 1.2
Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment: Upsloping
Number of Major Vessels: 0
Thalassemia: Normal
Conclusion
This application serves as a tool to predict the risk of heart disease based on health data. It uses machine learning models to analyze and generate predictions, which can be helpful for individuals to assess their health.

Future Enhancements
Add more data: Use more features or a larger dataset for training.
Improve Model: Explore other machine learning models for potentially better accuracy.
User Authentication: Allow users to create accounts and store their predictions.
